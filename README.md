# Ansible role for Telegraf

An Ansible role to install, configure, and manage [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdb/telegraf), the plugin-driven server agent for reporting metrics into InfluxDB.

Note: this is a fork of https://github.com/rossmcdonald/telegraf

## Requirements

Linux server (Debian/RedHat based), place to send the events too.
Prior knowledge/experience with InfluxDB and Telegraf is highly recommended. See output plugins [here](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf#output-plugins).

## Role Variables

The high-level variables are stored in the `defaults/main.yml` file. The most important ones being:

- `telegraf_output_plugins` - A list of dictionaries to configure your ouput plugins, for instance to influxdb or other destinations.
- `telegraf_input_plugins` - A list dictionaries to configure the metrics you want to collect. Either system metrics from the host the agent runs on or metrics of some services, DBs etc.
- `telegraf_custom_config_file` - A path to a file that contains (additional) telegraf config (can be a Jinja2 template too).

For more params see `defaults/main.yml`.

More advanced configuration options are stored in the `vars/main.yml` file, which includes all of the necessary bells and whistles to tweak your configuration.

## Dependencies

No other Ansible dependencies are required. This role was tested and developed with Ansible 1.9.4.
